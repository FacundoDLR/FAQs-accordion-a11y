## Overview

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to: 

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<details>
  <summary>Mostrar mÃ¡s</summary>
  <p>contenido</p>
</details>
```
How to remove native arrow from component
```css
details summary {
  cursor: pointer;
  position: relative;
  list-style: none;
}
```
To remove the arrow in browsers like Chrome and Safari we will use the `::-webkit-details-marker property`
```css
details summary::-webkit-details-marker {
  display: none;
}
```
